Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis 


Purpose: 

I am analysing the Pyber's ride-share data to find the differences between the three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The areas that will be explored for this analysis project is the general overview, rides, drivers, and fares in all three city types.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Summary
Based on the results listed above, I have come up with three different recommendations to address the disparities among the city types.

1.	Since rural city types make up 5.3% of rides (Fig6) and 6.8% of fares (Fig5), but only have 2.6% of drivers (Fig7). We should attract more drivers by showing that on average they can make more per ride compared to the other city types (Fig3).

2.	Similar to rural, suburban city types make up 26.3% of rides (Fig6) and 30.5% of fares, but only have 16.5% of drivers (Fig7). We should attract more drivers by showing they have the most consistent fares compared to the other city types (Fig3).

3.	Oppisite to rural and suburban city types, urban city types only have 68.4% of rides (Fig6) and 62.7% of fares, but have 80.9% of drivers. We should attract more riders by showing that on average their fares are the lowest of any city type (Fig3).
