Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis 


Purpose: 

I am analysing the Pyber's ride-share data to find the differences between the three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The areas that will be explored for this analysis project is the general overview, rides, drivers, and fares in all three city types.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Summary
According to the above findings I am presenting three different recommendations to address the disparities among the city types.
It can be achieved by showing that on average they can make more per ride compared to the other city types (Fig3).

2.	Similar to the  rural city types, the suburban city types are 26.3% of rides (Fig6) and 30.5% of fares, but only have 16.5% of drivers (Fig7). More drivers need to be attracted by showing they have the most consistent fares compared to the other city types (Fig3).

3.	Unlike the rural and the suburban city types, the urban city types only make up to 68.4% of rides (Fig6) and 62.7% of fares with 80.9% of drivers. Here more riders are in demand. It can be attracted by showing that on average their fares are the lowest of any city type (Fig3).
